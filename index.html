        <h1>Transforming passion for code into <b>innovative solutions</b></h1>
        <h2>
            Hello, I'm Gabriel, a dedicated professional at the age of 23. My passion for technology and innovation continually drives me to seek exciting challenges. 
            With experience as a Junior Systems Development Analyst, I delved into a realm where I shaped my expertise in technologies such as Flutter and Dart. 
            Currently, as a student of Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP, I am committed to expanding my knowledge to become a full-stack developer. 
            Integrating practical experience with academic education, I aim to make a meaningful contribution to the field of software development.
